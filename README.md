# LookWhatI-veMade

Look What I've Made is a Metroidvania in which you control two characters with different characteristics and abilities. The objective of the game is to escape from an underground prison to regain your powers and get to the surface. 

The game was developed in 10 weeks by a team of 5 students as a final project of the university year. At the end of the development a gala was held to award the best videogame, Look What I've Made won the prize (Tecnocampus - Pompeu Fabra University).

# My contribution
My role in the project was as a programmer. Some of my tasks consisted of:




- Implementing the character controller.
- Implementing the two skills of the two characters. With each character you can use two special abilities. The warrior can push his enemies or lift them up in the air in area doing damage. The mage can cast a lightning bolt that does damage or also create an electric aura around him that pushes enemies away and damages them.
- Implement enemy status machines. As well as their attacks and pathfinding method.
- Develop shaders and particle effects.
